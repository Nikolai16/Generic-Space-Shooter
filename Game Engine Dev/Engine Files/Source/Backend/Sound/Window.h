//window class deals with creating window for graphics class
//to draw to.  Also pools windows key events to input class
//also is the first thing to initialize and last thing to be destroyed

//nothing will inherit from window

class Window{

	//init will bring window up and make it ready for drawing
	//shutdown will remove it for drawing and delete the windows process
